Chicago zip code analysis of positive test rates

I looked at the city of Chicago data and found, in general, a trend where those zip codes that earn a higher income showed a lower Covid19 positive test rate. Those who earn the least are suffering the most. This short video explores this analysis using the Pandas merge function with publicly available datasets.
